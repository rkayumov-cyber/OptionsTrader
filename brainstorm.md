Application Concept: Cross-Market Equities Options Strategy Platform
Overview
The Cross-Market Equities Options Strategy Platform is a powerful tool for traders and investors in US, Japan, and HKEX equities markets. It delivers data-driven options strategies by integrating:

Uploaded market recommendations (PDFs from banks, research firms, or internal analysts)
Real-time prices and volatility surfaces (via a flexible MCP server)
Pre-trained narratives for different market regimes (bullish, bearish, volatile, sideways) in US, JP, and HKEX markets

Core Features
1. Real-Time, Market-Specific Strategy Recommendations

The platform analyzes both user-uploaded PDF reports and real-time prices/volatility surfaces to recommend optimal options strategies for US, Japan, and HKEX equities.
Pre-trained models are fine-tuned for each market’s unique characteristics and trading hours.
2. Provider-Agnostic MCP Server

Flexible Data Ingestion: Connects to any market data or options information provider for US, JP, and HKEX equities via standardized APIs or web scraping (where permitted).
Normalized Data Output: Aggregates and standardizes real-time prices, implied volatility surfaces, Greeks, and open interest across all three markets.
3. Third-Party Research Integration

Users can upload PDF reports from any financial institution.
The platform extracts and processes key insights, building a robust, market-specific knowledge base.
4. Continuous, Multi-Market Learning

The system learns from both uploaded documents and live data, keeping recommendations up-to-date for each market’s conditions.
5. Streamlined User Workflow

Upload: Add PDF reports or connect the MCP server to your preferred data providers for US, JP, and HKEX.
Analyze: The platform cross-references insights with real-time prices and volatility surfaces.
Recommend: Receive customized options strategies, complete with risk/reward analysis and market-specific rationale.

Why It Stands Out

Multi-Market Focus: Specialized for US, Japan, and HKEX equities options, with localized insights.
Real-Time Priority: Emphasizes real-time prices and volatility surfaces for timely, actionable strategies.
Provider-Agnostic: Works with any data provider, ensuring flexibility and future-proofing.
Efficient: Automates data extraction and analysis, saving time and reducing manual effort.
